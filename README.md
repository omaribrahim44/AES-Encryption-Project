# AES-Encryption-Project
This is an introduction to cyber security project where I just try the ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD algorithm to encrypt any string plaintext 
I implemented the AES 128-bit block cipher with 16-byte key
I changed it then into 24-byte key to implement AES 192-bit key
It also can measure time to decrept one block and then twoo blocks
